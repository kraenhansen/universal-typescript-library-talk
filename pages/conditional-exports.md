# Conditional exports ðŸ’™

Statically declare exported files, based on conditions of the runtime environment

https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports

<!--
Instead, you want to turn the import around and have runtime specific entrypoints which import and use common code.

Show of hands, who already knows about conditional exports?

<!--
You can use "conditional exports" via the "exports" key in your "package.json".

[click] Using a dot, we declare the exports for the package root - this takes precedence over any "main" field.
[click] We can tell TypeScript where the types for this package is located.
[click] We can tell Node.js what file it's supposed to load.
[click] We can tell a bundler, what file it's supposed to include when bundling for the web.

# Conditional exports ðŸ’™

"Runtime Keys" proposal by Winter CG defines a list of keys that represent various runtime environments:

https://runtime-keys.proposal.wintercg.org/

# Consuming conditional exports

From TypeScript

```json {4} 
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "customConditions": ["browser"]
  }
}
```

<!-- See https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#customConditions -->

- Can be used to declare experimental APIs.
- Often not needed, since it's only used when resolving types.

# Consuming conditional exports

From Node.js

```bash
node --conditions=development index.js
```

Defaults to `"node", "node-addons", "default", "import", "require"`

<!-- See https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#resolving-user-conditions -->

---

# Bundling conditional exports

From Vite / Rolldown

```javascript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    conditions: ["browser"]
  }
})
```

<!-- See https://v3.vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#resolve-conditions -->

---

# Bundling conditional exports

From Rspack

```javascript
// rspack.config.mjs
export default {
  resolve: {
    conditionNames: ["browser"]
  }
}
```

<!-- See https://rspack.dev/config/resolve#resolveconditionnames -->

# Bundling conditional exports

From Metro (for React Native)

- Used to be experimental (enabled via `unstable_enablePackageExports`)
- Enabled by default as of React Native 0.79.0 ðŸŽ‰

<!-- See https://metrobundler.dev/docs/package-exports/ -->

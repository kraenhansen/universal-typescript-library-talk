# Conditional exports ðŸ’™

Statically declare exported files, based on conditions of the runtime environment

https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports

<!--
Instead, you want to turn the import around and have runtime specific entrypoints which import and use common code.

Instead of single shared entrypoint, you want to statically declare the files you export, based on conditions of the runtime environment.

Show of hands, who already knows about conditional exports?

# Conditional exports ðŸ’™

<<< @/packages/my-lib/package.json {7|8,2|9|10|11} json

<!--
You can use "conditional exports" via the "exports" key in your "package.json".

[click] Using a dot, we declare the exports for the package root - this takes precedence over any "main" field.
[click] We can tell TypeScript where the types for this package is located.
[click] We can tell Node.js what file it's supposed to load.
[click] We can tell a bundler, what file it's supposed to include when bundling for the web.

# Conditional exports ðŸ’™

"Runtime Keys" proposal by Winter CG defines a list of keys that represent various runtime environments:

# Consuming conditional exports

From TypeScript

```json {4} 
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "customConditions": ["browser"]
  }
}
```

<!-- See https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#customConditions -->

- Can be used to declare experimental APIs.
- Often not needed, since it's only used when resolving types.

# Consuming conditional exports

From Node.js

```bash
node --conditions=development index.js
```

Defaults to `"node", "node-addons", "default", "import", "require"`

<!-- See https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#resolving-user-conditions -->

# Bundling conditional exports

From Vite / Rolldown

```javascript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    conditions: ["browser"]
  }
})
```

<!-- See https://v3.vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#resolve-conditions -->

# Bundling conditional exports

From Rspack

```javascript
// rspack.config.mjs
export default {
  resolve: {
    conditionNames: ["browser"]
  }
}
```

# Bundling conditional exports

From Metro (for React Native)

- Still experimental (enabled via `unstable_enablePackageExports`).
- Workaround using a `"react-native"` top-level "main field" (or a `"main"` combined with [platform specific file extensions](https://reactnative.dev/docs/platform-specific-code)).

<!--
First, a bit about myself.

[click] I help build developer tools at MongoDB, primarily Compass, an Electron based GUI to query and administer a database cluster.
[click] I help maintain the Atlas Device SDK for TypeScript (formerly Realm JS). Lots of TypeScript, a bit of C++, supports multiple runtime environments, operating systems and JavaScript engines.
[click] Outside of work, I'm a proud father of two 6yo twin girls and a 2yo girl.
[click] Besides my work at MongoDB (where I work ~ 30 hours per week) and family I like to build in the public.
[click] Write to me on Bluesky - any feedback is appreciated.

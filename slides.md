# Building a<br>Universal TypeScript Library

KrÃ¦n Hansen

<!--
Welcome to my talk about
"Building a Universal TypeScript Library".

I'm going to talk about some patterns for building libraries
meant to run across many environments (browsers, node.js, react-native, etc.)

Show of hands - do you consider yourself an app developer?
How about a library developer?

If you're not a library developer?
- Maybe you are? Your solutions could be generalized and published as a library.
- You're evaluating libraries, which might use some of these patterns.
- These patterns also apply when working in a mono-repo.
